Nested views are rendered\n * next to each other. The views can be rendered next to each other, but the max number of visible\n * views can be limisted as well. This is configurable in the CSS layer, so that the max number of views\n * per split-view can be different for each component.\n *\n * The basic structure of the split-view component is shown below:\n *\n *\n * ```\n * <cx-split-view>\n * </cx-split-view>\n * ```\n *\n * The UX pattern used for the split-view is driven by an initial view, which gets splitted into\n * more views as soon as the user starts interacting with the initial and subsequantial views.\n * The views can be driven by routes, which means that you can navigate through the splitted views\n * by using the browser history as well as share or bookmark splitted views.\n *\n * The UI is implemented in the style layer, with only a few generic style rules. Most of the split\n * view style is driven by CSS properties, so that alternative split-view styles can be introduced\n * per page or component.\n *\n * The max number of views per split-view on mobile is limited to 1 by default, where as on tablet\n * (and higher) it is set to 2. Spartacus has a pretty narrow layout, which is why 2 is maximum,\n * but customers could alter the layout to bring in more views in the same split-view at the time.\n *\n */\nexport declare class SplitViewModule {\n}\n"]}
