/**
 * Directive that provides persistence of the focused state. This is useful
 * when a group of focusable elements got refocused or even recreated. That
 * happens often when the DOM is constructed with an `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`.
 *
 * The focus state is based on a configured _key_, which can be passed in the
 * config input, either by using a string primitive or `PersistFocusConfig.key`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <button cxPersistFocus="myKey"></button>
 * <button cxFocus="myKey"></button>
 * <button [cxFocus]="{{key:'myKey'}"></button>
 * ```
 *
 * The focus state can be part of a focus _group_, so that the state is shared
 * and remember for the given group. In order to detect the persistence for a
 * given element, we store the persistence key as a data attribute (`data-cx-focus`):
 *
 * ```html
 * <button data-cx-focus="myKey"></button>
 * ```
 *
 * Other keyboard focus directives can read the key to understand whether the element
 * should retrieve focus.
